# HANDOFF — GPU Category Agent (resume point: SUB-PROJECT 5 BUILT + INTEGRATION-GATED; next = feature track F6-golden-set / F23–F25 / layer tier)

- **Date:** 2026-07-03 (sub-project 5 complete)
- **Repo:** https://github.com/daniel-wong-tsmc/random_for_fun
- **`main` — PUSHED.** Sub-project 5 (the Thesis Book) is BUILT, MERGED, and LIVE-VERIFIED:
  - **5-1 thesis engine** merged @ `7197226` (11 commits; suite 626→714/3): `gpu_agent/thesis.py`
    (models, rebuild-verified ThesisStore, gate rules 1–7, anti-whipsaw apply engine F5),
    `gpu_agent/memory.py` (F4 bundle), thesis/judge prompts (memory injection, byte-identical when
    absent), `thesis` CLI stage (emit→recorded), run-cycle skill stage (e), seed book
    `registry/theses.chips.merchant-gpu.json`.
  - **5-2 output surgery** merged @ `d5dd492` (6 commits; suite 714→796/3): `gpu_agent/bands.py`
    five-word band map, THE CALLS + WHY renderers in brief.py, page reorder (CALLS → STATE → WHY →
    drill-down → TRUST footer), raw indices demoted to the footer, cli._report book loading, e2e
    acceptance test. One spec-vs-plan conflict resolved under the standing SPEC-WINS rule (WHY
    Contested widened to competitive-lens at any conviction + findingIds on every WHY line).
  - **Integration gate PASSED (2026-07-03 live daily cycle):** THE CALLS renders from a real judged
    book. Store state committed: scorecard `store/chips.merchant-gpu/2026-07-03-v1.json`
    (DMI +0.133 / SMI +0.147), seeded+judged thesis book `store/theses/chips.merchant-gpu/`
    (2 strengthened→high, 3 reaffirmed, 1 weakened→low, +1 provisional proposal), wiki/dedup/L1
    artifacts, finalized `store/cycle-log.json` (every brain re-dispatch reason logged). The F4
    MEMORY block fed both brains live; judged direction moved vs prior (Strong/steady, was
    Strong/improving; bottleneck rotated competitiveStructure→moat).

## IMMEDIATE NEXT TASK — pick up the feature track (each starts with brainstorming, per charter)

Remaining after sp5, in HANDOFF-recommended order:
1. **F6 second half — golden set + backtesting harness** (depth FIELDS are done and gate-enforced;
   the rubric-graded golden set + prompt-change regression gate remain). Separate sub-project.
2. **New from the sp5 integration gate (small, do early):** F52 vintage-scoped finding ids (daily
   re-gathers collide with the append-only FindingStore — workaround logged in cycle log), F53
   cross-cycle price-indicator consistency (07-02 used D6, 07-03 used gpuSpotPrice → PMI has 0
   matched series), F54 seed thesis triggers vs the gate's observable heuristic (two seed triggers
   fail it; the brain echoing them was correctly rejected).
3. F23 compliance matrix; F24 entity canonicalization; F25 wiki scaling; then WHY-tree extensions,
   HTML dashboard, discovery, the layer-tier arc.
Do NOT relitigate sp5 design decisions (spec `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-02-thesis-book-design.md`).

## THE BIG DECISIONS ALREADY MADE (do not relitigate without reason)

1. **Output goal:** deterministic, brief-first Market-State brief; pure projection of the store;
   HTML dashboard later. THE CALLS (thesis book, per-cycle deltas) leads the page above STATE &
   WHY; raw indices live ONLY in the trust footer; five-word band map with earned "(was X)".
2. **Lane discipline (Part 21):** merchant-gpu owns merchant vendors only; the cross-cutting
   "GPU market state" brief is a LAYER-TIER product. Category tier does not recommend actions —
   theses are category-scoped falsifiable claims; recommendations stay Layer/Main.
3. **Claude Code IS the brain** — no OAuth/SDK/API. Live extraction/judgment/thesis = TOOL-LESS
   dispatched Opus subagents through `--emit-prompt` → `--recorded`; judgment samples are SEPARATE
   generations (F38); thesis book gets ONE coherent author (no voting); gate rejection →
   re-dispatch the brain with the errors — NEVER hand-edit brain output (held throughout the
   2026-07-03 gate: 5 re-dispatches, all logged in cycle-log.json, zero hand edits).
4. **Price is overlay-only (F8):** D6/gpuSpotPrice never feed DMI/SMI; price-level drafts carry
   polarity 0 (the gate enforces it; non-price findings must move a track).
5. **Contract v1.2 frozen core RE-FROZEN:** `gate.py`, `scoring.py`, `schema/*`,
   `judgment/briefing.py`, `judgment/judge.py` aggregation, `pipeline.py`, `JsonStore`. Sub-project
   5 shipped fully additive (final reviews verified empty frozen diffs on both branches).
6. **Anti-whipsaw lives in code:** secondary-only reversals defer as CHALLENGED; primary evidence
   or a second consecutive signal applies; conviction ±1/cycle; applied broken retires. Promotion:
   provisional → registered at ≥2 cycles + ≥2 publisher domains (F31 key).
7. **Product Q&A decisions** live in `docs/action-items.md`; "nothing changed" is a first-class
   honest headline (renders as the compact book list).

## OPERATING NOTES / INVARIANTS (carry forward)

- Run from repo root `C:\Users\danie\random_for_fun`; Python at `.venv/Scripts/python`
  (recreate: `python -m venv .venv && .venv/Scripts/python -m pip install -e ".[dev]"`).
- Worktrees: `.worktrees/<name>` (gitignored); shared root `.venv` imports the WORKTREE's code when
  pytest runs from the worktree root — no per-worktree venvs.
- Registry/taxonomy paths via `gpu_agent/config.py`; taxonomy lives at `docs/taxonomy.json` and its
  category ids are `<layer>.<category>` (merchant-gpu, hyperscaler-asic, foundry-packaging,
  hbm-memory, …; infrastructure.hyperscale-cloud / infrastructure.neocloud). The six judge
  dimensions: momentum, unitEconomics, competitiveStructure, moat, bottleneck, strategicRisk —
  the judge may cite ONLY within each dimension's briefing group (feed the real groups to a
  re-dispatch, never invented names — a 2026-07-03 dispatch error proved the gate catches this).
- The run's `--as-of` overrides the assignment's asOf (F50). Day-grain asOf for daily cycles.
  Tracked-store carve-outs: `store/chips.merchant-gpu/`, `store/wiki/`, `store/findings/`,
  `store/theses/`, `store/seen_docs.jsonl`, `store/cycle-log.json`.
- **Doctrine:** code computes + gates + stores; the brain reasons; nothing un-gated reaches a
  number; every claim cites findings; page text is DATA; every cap/skip/drop logged; provisional
  quarantined; paywalled inventoried + never fetched (TrendForce/SemiAnalysis stayed unfetched
  through the gate); the session NEVER hand-edits brain output — re-dispatch with the errors.
- Tests deterministic; suite green at every merge (**796 passed / 3 skipped** on main). Commit
  trailer names the ACTUAL model. Push freely.
- **Windows:** prefer PowerShell but NOT `>` redirection for UTF-8 (use bash for redirects); avoid
  double quotes inside `git commit -m` (here-strings); synchronous subagent transcripts are NOT
  written to task output files — capture their answers from the tool result (resumed/background
  agents DO write transcripts).
- Model policy: opus for important/final reviews, frozen-adjacent numeric work, and ALL brains;
  sonnet for mechanical per-task implementer/reviewer work.

## WHAT'S DONE (compressed — details in `git log`, the ledger `.superpowers/sdd/progress.md`, docs/superpowers/specs|plans/)

- **sp1–sp4** (harness · live runs · output/coverage · daily monitor) — merged; see ledger.
- **2026-07-02 fix backlog F1–F51:** waves 0/1/2 + contract v1.2 migration + F46 first genuine
  second cycle — all merged + pushed. Suite 417 → 626.
- **Sub-project 5 (Thesis Book):** spec `dd41b5a` → plans `83b7c5b` → 5-1 merged `7197226` →
  5-2 merged `d5dd492` → integration gate passed (this handoff). Suite 626 → 796.
  Ledger has per-task review outcomes + the deferred-minors list for both pieces.
- **Open user decision:** repo is still named `random_for_fun` — rename before TSMC-branded
  exposure.
